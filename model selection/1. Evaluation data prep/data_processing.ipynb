Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.\",\n","     \"final_decision\": \"maybe\"\n","}\n","{\n","     \"pubid\": 26449554,\n","     \"question\": \"Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?\",\n","     \"context\": {\n","          \"contexts\": [\n","               \"The pressures delivered by autotitrating continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) devices not only treat obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) effectively but also give potentially interesting physiological information about the forces impinging on the pharynx.

An override was added on 10/2/06 by Gerad E. Dancy, PA for POTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION: AMIODARONE HCL & WARFARIN with the reason for override being monitoring. The patient was rehydrated with IVF and PO's were encouraged, holding Glypizide while in house, Novolog sliding scale was started on 1/2, Low dose NPH 6 units BID was started on 1/2, bridged with lovenox and INR therapeutic 1/2 and restarted on home regimen of 5/2.5mg variable dose. Pain was controlled with TYLENOL (ACETAMINOPHEN) 650 MG PO Q4H PRN Pain, Headache. A CT pelvis showed a right adnexal cyst which will need further characterization by US and outpatient follow up. The patient has an extensive cardiac history and the fall is not likely related to a cardiac issue as it appears mechanical, with no syncope, chest pain, etc. She was diagnosed with an NSTEMI with a small TnI leak, likely demand related in the setting of hypovolemia and the fall. Enzymes trended down. She was dry on admission and rehydrated with IVF, PO's encouraged, and became euvolemic by 1/2. Her JVP was up to 12cm, although it was difficult to gauge her volume status due to TR. She had a prolonged QT on admission, on telemetry, of unclear etiology, possibly starvation.

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.\\nThe following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.\",\n","  \"question\": \"Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?\",\n","  \"text\": [\n","    \"yes\",\n","    \"no\",\n","    \"maybe\"\n","  ],\n","  \"encode\": [\n","    \"A\",\n","    \"B\",\n","    \"C\"\n","  ],\n","  \"answer\": \"A\"\n","}\n","\n","==================== SAMPLES FOR: MEDQUAD ====================\n","{\n","  \"id\": \"0000559-1\",\n","  \"dataset\": \"medquad\",\n","  \"split\": \"all\",\n","  \"context\": null,\n","  \"question\": \"What is (are) keratoderma with woolly hair ?\",\n","  \"text\": [\n","    \"Keratoderma with woolly hair is a group of related conditions that affect the skin and hair and in many cases increase the risk of potentially life-threatening heart problems.

Type II, also known as Carvajal syndrome, has hair and skin abnormalities similar to type I but features a different form of cardiomyopathy, called dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy.
