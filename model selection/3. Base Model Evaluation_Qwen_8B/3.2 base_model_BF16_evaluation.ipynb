Enzymes trended down. She was dry on admission and rehydrated with IVF, PO's encouraged, and became euvolemic by 1/2. Her JVP was up to 12cm, although it was difficult to gauge her volume status due to TR. She had a prolonged QT on admission, on telemetry, of unclear etiology, possibly starvation.

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.\\nThe following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.\",\n","  \"question\": \"Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?\",\n","  \"text\": [\n","    \"yes\",\n","    \"no\",\n","    \"maybe\"\n","  ],\n","  \"encode\": [\n","    \"A\",\n","    \"B\",\n","    \"C\"\n","  ],\n","  \"answer\": \"A\"\n","}\n","\n","==================== SAMPLES FOR: MEDQUAD ====================\n","{\n","  \"id\": \"0000559-1\",\n","  \"dataset\": \"medquad\",\n","  \"split\": \"all\",\n","  \"context\": null,\n","  \"question\": \"What is (are) keratoderma with woolly hair ?\",\n","  \"text\": [\n","    \"Keratoderma with woolly hair is a group of related conditions that affect the skin and hair and in many cases increase the risk of potentially life-threatening heart problems.
